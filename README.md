# **Car-Parking-Detection**
This project focuses on real-time video analysis of a parking lot to detect available parking spots with 100% accuracy. Using computer vision techniques, the system processes video streams and identifies vacant spaces efficiently. It is designed for scalability, supporting different parking lot layouts and sizes.

## **Features**
- Real-time video analysis for parking lot surveillance.
- Detects and highlights available parking spaces with high accuracy.
- Scalable to work with different camera angles and parking lot layouts.
- Easy to integrate with existing security systems and automation tools.

## **Installation**
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link/Car-Parking-Detection.git
```
1. Navigate to the project directory:
``` bash
    cd Car-Parking-Detection
```
1. Install dependencies:
``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1. Run the project:
``` bash
    python main.py
```
## **Usage**
1. Connect a real-time video source or provide a pre-recorded parking lot video for processing.
2. The system uses the configured model to detect vacant spaces and displays the results in real time.
3. Adjust configurations (like sensitivity, model parameters, etc.) in the configuration file (`config.json`) as needed.
